          <h1> WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF TIC-TAC-TOE</h1>
            
          <p style="font-size: 33px; color: darkblue;"> Many moons ago I obtained a Bachelors degree in Economics and a Masters degree in International 
       Economics and Finance. Very recently I finished the Lambda School Data Science program specializing in Data Engineering and Machine Learning.
       And now I am here to bring computers to life and create a Tic-Tac-Toe program that is invincible. 
  
  <p style="font-size: 33px; color: rgb(0, 139, 132);"> Neural networks learn through experimentation and Back-Propogation.
    By designing this algorithm, and playing against it many times, I began to realize how the reward system works
    within neural networks, but also within the human brain. To train the machine, one must attempt to understand
    the way in which their own brain functions.
  <p style="font-size: 33px; color: rgb(205, 50, 192);">
    Within the scope of a task, when someone or something is properly incentivized, they set forth down a path which will give them the best chance to succeed.
   If they are misguided or do not properly evaluate the factors in the game that they are playing,
    they will set forth down a path destined for failure. 
    <p style="font-size: 33px; color: rgb(16, 139, 0);">
    As you play against this clever computer, try and set yourself down a path which will give you the best chance 
    of victory. And while you may only ever achieve a tie, if you properly align your thought process with your goals, 
    you will have improved your ability to think and reason, and will leave this site better off 
    then when you arrived.

        will you see this take effect, it will swap, and offset -->
