#Need to instruct the computer square, where to go, once i draw a shape
# It then needs to move there, and draw the opposite shape
# there are 8 possible lines to win tic tac toe, 3 across, 3 down, 2 diagonal,
# when the player draws on a specific line, that line count gets incremented, from 0->1->2->3
# so basically, the computer will move to a spot with the highest count, and place the opposite drawing
# in the case of a tie, the computer will choose randomly among the tied lines, move to a spot on one of them, and draw

# so basically, we have to program 8 coordinate systems, each line has 3, and the computer will move to a spot 
# on one of those lines, as long as we program his movement correctly...does not matter how computer reaches proper coordinate
# computer could take the shortest route to coordinate system, in case of a tie, if there is a tie, and choices are same distance, 
# computer will choose randomly

# when a line is not able to reach 3 in count, it is crossed off of a list, so the computer will not be able to move back to it
# once it has originally moved there

# if player chooses the first spot in the middle, computer has to randomly choose a corner option to move to
#if players first move is in middle, computer needs to first go to opposite corner

#once the initial computer move has been made, then we implement the other loop, which moves along highest count lines, based 
# on proximity, this will mean computer is really smart

# in the weird option that human is trying to trick computer, computer will always try to finish his own line, if hes at 2,
# before trying to block humans 2

#start with random roll from 0-1, x = random.randint(0,1), if 0, computer starts, if 1, player starts
# Computer, if he goes first , will place a piece at random, otherwise,

# It will find the winning line arrays with the lowest counts...
# It will then access the TicTacdict and basically randomly choose a key from the lowest counts keys, move to that spot,
# and the process will repeat
# 
# obviously, this is only relevant when the computer is choosing, the player will make up his own mind
# 
# If the computer is first to act, it will find that all values in the remaining dict are the same, and so it should
# randomly select a key from the Tictacdict, choose one of the lists, and check to see if the value is a key in the TicTacDict...
# if it finds that it is a key, it will move to the coordinates, and draw...just going to randomly select, and outside while loop, 
# if its choice is 0, it will draw 0s, if its random int is 1, it will draw X's. 

# For every x or o that is drawn, increment the count, the while loop will run until the count is not < 9...
