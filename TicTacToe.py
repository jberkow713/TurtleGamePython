#To do
# There will be an X and an O Remaining Dict, with possible winning lines, and counts for those lines
# There will be ONE shared TicTacdict , that already is in place, with possible spots to move to 
# Each turn, player will check the possible remaining keys in TicTacDict, 
# Then, you check to see, for each key, how many winning lines in your RemainingDict use that key, and how many of those lines
# have your opponents count at the starting count...in this case 3...a line that uses the key, and has corresponding opponents count
# at starting count, gives you ONE point...
# You tally up the points for that given Key, put in new dictionary, Called Winning lines, and return the key, with the highest
# value

#This is in general how you choose...
# In the case of a tie, you choose the key that makes the difference between one of your lines and their lines, the highest

# Every turn, you need to check your dictionary, before you choose, to see if they have a value of 1, and you have a value of 
# starting count, for any given line...in that case, you MUST move to that line, and obviously, to the only remaining key, 
# block them, erase key, erase the winning line from BOTH yours and opponents dictionary

# In the case of a scenario where there are no more winning lines, and all keys give 0 points, such as near the end of the game,
# randomly choose a tile, and with one tile left, force into that tile
